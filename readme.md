#Mini Pirates!
##Survive as a pirate captian for 30 days!
By pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard, decide the fate of your ship and crew! The objective is to **hoard as much treasure as you can eat**!

## Tips!

* Watch your stats at the bottom!
* You can see how each choice will affect your stats by the corresponding letter. (e.g. A = Anger, G = Grog, C = Crew and CB = Cannonballs.)
* Your crew will mutiny if you have no treasure!
* If you promise the crew grog, and you don't have any, you'll be in trouble!
* If you anger your crew off too much, they'll mutiny!
* Don't scare the crew too much, or they will abandon ship!
* Make sure you have enough cannonballs when engage an enemy!
* Get as much treasure as you can!
